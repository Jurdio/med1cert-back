**Configuring Git operations**

I'm figuring out the current branch with a command and checking remotes. If the origin exists, I'll set the URL; if not, I'll add it. The goal is to push with a non-interactive setup since authentication for GitHub over HTTPS might prompt for credentials. I'll suggest using a token or switching to SSH if needed. I want to ensure smooth operations without user interaction and to handle authentication appropriately.
**Preparing to push changes**

I'm preparing to attempt a push, ensuring I'm in the correct workspace directory first. The tool indicates that if I'm in a new shell, I should navigate to the project directory explicitly. My "Workspace Path" is /Users/dmytro/privy-admin, but I'll confirm I'm in the root and use an absolute path. It seems I can chain commands with "&&" for a smooth flow, but for getting the current branch name, I can use subshells for that purpose.
**Executing a command sequence**

The tool requires commands without newlines, so I'll set it up as: `cd /Users/dmytro/privy-admin && CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD) && if git remote get-url origin >/dev/null 2>&1; then git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Jurdio/med1cert-back.git; else git remote add origin https://github.com/Jurdio/med1cert-back.git; fi && git push -u origin "$CURRENT_BRANCH" | cat`.

I’ll provide a status update before running the command, and after executing, I’ll summarize the results and check if further commands are necessary. I need to be cautious about possible failures, especially regarding the remote settings.
**Setting the origin and pushing**

The user has requested to set the origin and push their local branch, so I'll handle that. I plan to output a summary that includes the remote and branch name, detailing whether the operation succeeded or failed. Afterward, I might need to run `git remote -v` to verify the settings, but I’ll keep it minimal. Here’s the command I'll use: 

`cd /Users/dmytro/privy-admin && BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD) && if git remote get-url origin >/dev/null 2>&1; then git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Jurdio/med1cert-back.git; else git remote add origin https://github.com/Jurdio/med1cert-back.git; fi && echo "Pushing branch: $BRANCH" && git push -u origin "$BRANCH" | cat`. 

There’s no need for a to-do list since it's a straightforward task; I'll provide a status update and then run the command. After execution, I'll give a final summary of the results. Let's move forward with this!</details></think>

I'll set the Git remote to the provided URL and push your current local branch to it. Running the command now.

отак треба ало

git remote add origin https://github.com/Jurdio/med1cert-back.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

**Executing git commands**

I’m thinking through the commands the user wants: `git branch -M main` for renaming, and then `git push -u origin main` to push. I need to decide if I should run them as a single command or separately. It might be better to combine them to minimize calls and stop on errors. The user wants them just as specified. I'll explain I'm executing the commands as requested before proceeding with the tool call.
**Running git commands and summarizing results**

I need to provide a result summary after running the user's requested commands: changing directories, adding a remote, renaming the branch, and pushing to GitHub. However, I must consider that pushing might require authentication, which may not be configured. If authentication fails, I'll capture that and let the user know to log in or provide credentials. Since interactive authentication isn't possible, I can suggest setting up a token or using GitHub's CLI to authenticate more easily.
**Attempting commands now**

I think it's time to go ahead and attempt the commands. If they fail, I'll make sure I handle any issues that come up appropriately. It's important to keep things straightforward and efficient, so I'll execute the commands as requested and be ready to troubleshoot if anything goes wrong. Let's get started!</details></think>

I'll run the exact three commands you specified to add the remote, set branch to main, and push upstream.
